### Cooperation Plan

- What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
    - **Anthony** - 
    - **Isaiah** - I've been practicing with CSS, I'm no expert but I am more comfortable with it.  I'm good with JS and HTML and am willing to pick up any portion of the project.
    - **Mandela** -
    - **Nicholas** - Although I can do HTML and CSS I am most comfortable working in javascript. It's the language where I have the most practice and enjoy the most.
- How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
    - **Anthony** - 
    - **Isaiah** - We'll be able to divide and conquer more effectively within our team.
    - **Mandela** -
    - **Nicholas** - With a good understanding of JS we can come up with a great plan/design before we start.  
- In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
    - **Anthony** - 
    - **Isaiah** - I'd like to be stronger with JS and CSS primarily.
    - **Mandela** -
    - **Nicholas** - I want to get some experience working as a group on the same project. 
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
    - **Anthony** - 
    - **Isaiah** - I think staying on together and working on small features individually that we regularly push together would keep us all up to date.
    - **Mandela** -
    - **Nicholas** - I think the meeting in the morning will help keep us organized, as well as having a solid plan at the start.

### Conflict Plan

- What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
    - When conflict arises we will pause to make decisions as a group unless that isn't possible.  The members available will get together and use their best judgement, then update the remaining members when possible.
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
    - That isn't acceptable, if that occurs we will remedy the issue.  From our first meeting it does not seem like that will be a problem.
- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
    - We will play on our strengths and let each other know when problems arise.  If we can't solve it together we will contact a TA
- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
    - We will try to include everyone as much as possible.  It seems like our main issue will computer or internet issues.  Based on our first meeting we are all interested in tackling this project.
- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
    - We will take our conflicts to the appropriate leadership as soon as we know there is an issue we can't resolve on our own.

### Communication Plan


- What hours will you be available to communicate?
    - Over the weekend our time available is different, we will stay in contact via slack.  During project week we plan on spending the normal hours we spend, either in class or working after class, working together.  Outside of those hours we plan on working on our own designated features on individual branches.
- What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
    - Slack and remo primarily
- How often will you take breaks?
    - When necessary, we are all adults and can make those decisions accordingly.  I plan to take a break at minimum every 2 hours
- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
    - Find out the reason and try to help each other over rough patches.
- How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
    - Slack
- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
    - We respect each other's input
- How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
    - Make sure everyone is heard.

### Work Plan


- How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
    - We will be able to make more concrete plans when our project has been approved.
- What project management tool will be used?
    - Possibly a kanban board.

### Schedule your practice session

Work with your instructor to pre-schedule an date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.

Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:

- Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
- When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.
- Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”
